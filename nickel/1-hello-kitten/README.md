## 1-Hello-Kitten

A "hello world" example created from vanilla "cargo new".

```
cargo new hello-kitten
```

Then replaced `main.rs` with the hello world code [here](https://nickel-org.github.io/) and added nickel to the cargo.toml file.

Run with:
```
cargo run
```

## Thoughts

Nickel is a very fast, easy-to-read server written in Rust.

I like the modular "import things from small packages" style reminiscent of expressJs. üëç
